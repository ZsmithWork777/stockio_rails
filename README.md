# StockIO v2  
**Production-Style Inventory Management System**  
Rails 8 · Turbo / Hotwire · PostgreSQL · JSON API

StockIO v2 is a full-stack inventory management application rebuilt from the ground up using **Ruby on Rails 8**, **Turbo / Hotwire**, and **PostgreSQL**.

This project is intentionally designed as a **real, production-style Rails application**, not a tutorial demo.  
It emphasizes correctness, observability, clean architecture, and real-time behavior without frontend complexity.

---

## Project Goals

- Build a real inventory system with correct CRUD behavior
- Use Turbo Frames and Turbo Streams properly
- Support both **HTML (web)** and **JSON (API)** consumers
- Track system mutations with an audit log
- Maintain a clean, scalable, production-ready codebase

---

## Features

### Inventory (Items)
- Full CRUD lifecycle
- Quantity tracking
- Category association
- Safe deletes
- Turbo Stream updates for create, update, and destroy
- Zero page reloads for item mutations

### Categories
- Full category CRUD
- Category management dashboard
- Category-scoped item views
- Proper ActiveRecord relationships

### Search, Filter, Sort
- Search items by name
- Filter items by category
- Sort by:
  - Name (ASC / DESC)
  - Quantity (ASC / DESC)

---

## CSV Import / Export

- Export inventory to CSV
- Import inventory from CSV
- CSV operations exposed via API
- Turbo explicitly bypassed where full requests are required
- Production-safe parsing and updates

---

## API v1 (JSON)

RESTful JSON API under `/api/v1`

### Items
- `GET /api/v1/items`
- `GET /api/v1/items/:id`
- `POST /api/v1/items`
- `PATCH /api/v1/items/:id`
- `DELETE /api/v1/items/:id`
- `GET /api/v1/items/export`
- `POST /api/v1/items/import`

### Categories
- Full REST support

The API shares models and business logic with the web layer while remaining stateless and JSON-only.

---

## Audit Logging (System Observability)

StockIO includes a dedicated **audit logging system** to track all system mutations.

### Tracked Events
- Item creation
- Item updates
- Item deletion
- API-initiated changes

### Stored Data
- Action type (`item_create`, `api_create`, `api_update`, etc.)
- Record type
- Record ID
- Change details stored as `jsonb`
- Timestamp

Audit logs are viewable through a dedicated **Activity Log UI**.

---

## Analytics Dashboard

- Total item count
- Total quantity in stock
- Most stocked item
- Lowest stock item

All metrics are computed directly from persisted inventory data.

---

## UI / UX

- TailwindCSS
- Glassmorphism-style cards
- Responsive layouts
- Reusable partials and components
- Turbo Frames wrapping item cards
- Turbo Streams used for all mutations

The UI is intentionally minimal to keep focus on data and behavior.

---

## Architecture

### Stack
- Ruby on Rails 8
- PostgreSQL
- Turbo / Hotwire
- TailwindCSS

### Controllers
- Web controllers for HTML flows
- API controllers under `Api::V1`
- Thin controllers with logic pushed to models

### Models
- `Item`
- `Category`
- `AuditLog`

### Database
- PostgreSQL
- `jsonb` columns for audit details
- Strong parameters enforced across controllers

---
